        <h2>What are STIs?</h2>
        <p>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are infections passed from one person to another through sexual contact. They can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.</p>

        <h2>How are STIs Transmitted?</h2>
        <p>STIs are primarily spread through unprotected sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some STIs can also be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or sharing needles.</p>

        <h2>Curable vs. Manageable STIs</h2>
        <p>Some STIs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are curable with antibiotics. Others, like HIV and herpes, are manageable but not curable.</p>

        <h2>Getting Tested</h2>
        <p>Regular STI testing is crucial for sexual health. Many STIs can be asymptomatic, so testing helps detect infections early. Testing is available at clinics, hospitals, and at-home kits.</p>

        <h2>Talking to Your Partner</h2>
        <p>Having open and honest conversations about STIs with your partner is important. Choose a calm moment, be honest about your status, and encourage mutual testing for a healthy relationship.</p>
